# evm.zig

Zig implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

**It is my first Zig project** as my learning path to Zig. I'm sure there are many things that can be improved, feebacks are very welcome.

If you are looking for more comprehensive zig ethereum projects, I recommend checkout [zabi](https://github.com/Raiden1411/zabi).
